# Pretator

A compass to point you to your nearest open Prêt à Manger. *Get to the Choc Bar!*

Data is derived from Jonty Wareing's [Pretadata][pretadata].

## Installation

Pretator is a fairly standard Rails application. It requires PostgresSQL as a datastore, with [PostGIS][postgis] installed in the database. Once you've configured your database, a quick `bundle` should be enough to install all dependencies.
